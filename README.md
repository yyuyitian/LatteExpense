a money counter helps arrange your expense in daily life,

help you predict the assert you will have in coming years according to your proportion of daily expenses, your professionï¼Œ your debt.

not just a counter, but a intelligent friend who can dynamicly help you adjust your expense when your spending rhythm is too fast, or over your expectation.

the idea comes from the facts that people often spend money irrationally as a way to relieve stress. Over time, this accumulation of poor financial decisions can lead to perpetual poverty. If individuals could predict the consequences of their spending habits early on, they could avoid such a tragic outcome. However, most existing budgeting apps are merely numerical calculators and lack the ability to dynamically forecast future consequences, leaving users unaware of their irrational spending patterns.

Forecasting how much money individuals will accumulate in the future can be challenging due to the many variables involved. Here are some suggestions to consider in the forecasting process:

Historical Data: Analyze and consider historical data to identify trends and patterns in personal finances. Look at past saving and spending habits, income growth, and debt repayment history to derive insights and project future behavior.

Income Growth: Take into account potential income growth based on factors such as career progression, industry trends, and inflation rates. Consider future salary increases, promotions, or additional income streams to estimate the potential growth in savings.

Expense Projection: Analyze individual spending patterns and project future expenses based on factors like inflation, lifestyle changes, anticipated major expenses (e.g., housing, education, retirement), and debt repayment schedules. It's important to consider both regular and irregular expenses.

Savings Rate and Investment Returns: Consider the proportion of income that individuals can save or invest. Evaluate different saving and investment strategies and simulate the impact of different savings rates and investment returns on future asset accumulation.
